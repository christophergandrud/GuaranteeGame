A simple Python based simulation of a banking crisis containment signalling game with two signallers. The simulation illustrates the model developed in "Information and Financial Crisis Policymaking" (forthcoming at the *Journal of European Public Policy*).

A working paper describing the underlying model and simulation results can be found at: <http://ssrn.com/abstract=2353839>.
